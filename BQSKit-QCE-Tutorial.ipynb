    "There's a lot new in the above example. First, we defined a new pass by subclassing `BasePass` and implementing a `run` method. This pass just prints the number of Controlled-not gates in the circuit when executed. We then use this before and inside a `WhileLoopPass` to see the progress of execution. Second, we perform a `WhileLoopPass` which takes a predicate and a sequence of passes. It will apply the passes supplied until the predicate produces false. We supplied a `GateCountPredicate` which evaluates to False when the specific gate count stops changing."
